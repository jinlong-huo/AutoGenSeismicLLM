      "2. **Preprocessing and Quality Control**\n",
      "   - Perform preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, filtering, and interpolation to improve data quality.\n",
      "   - Conduct quality control checks to identify and correct any inconsistencies or errors in the datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Integration and Alignment**\n",
      "   - Align the datasets spatially and temporally using common reference points (e.g., horizons, faults, or markers).\n",
      "   - Use geophysical software tools to integrate the datasets into a unified framework where they can be analyzed together.\n",
      "\n",
